add toFloatPrec(), toDoublePrec(), and toRealPrec()

Some floating point algorithms, such as
Kahan-Babuska-Neumaier Summation, require rounding
to specific precisions. Rounding to precision after
every operation, however, loses overall precision in
the general case and is a runtime performance problem.

Adding these functions guarantee the rounding at required
points in the code, and document where in the algorithm
the requirement exists.
